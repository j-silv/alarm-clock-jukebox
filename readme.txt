This is the C source code for my alarm clock jukebox. The device uses a Nios II embedded softcore
IP from Quartus, programmed on a MAX 10 FPGA. 

The board support files are not included in the repo, but were generated from an empty Eclipse
project template and an .sopcinfo file obtained from using Platform Designer and compilation in Quartus.
