Here is the project repo for my alarm clock that plays cellphone ringtones (i.e., a "jukebox"!)

The device uses a Nios II embedded softcore IP from Quartus, programmed on a MAX 10 FPGA. 
The ringtones are obtained through RTTTL (Ring Tones Text Transfer Language).

NAVIGATING THE REPO:

The C source code can be found in the software/ folder.
The block diagrams for the device can be found in the diagrams/ folder.
